                <span class="blog-title">HSTPA PRESENTATION at KELLER WILLIAMS</span> <br>
                <span class="blog-info">posted <b><i>Friday, August 9, 2019</i></b></span>
                <p>After the 2019 Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act passed on June 20th, those involved in the real
                estate/housing markets have been heavily impacted because of the drastic change. There was much to learn and teach about
                its effects on cooperatives/condos and rent-stabilized apartments. Fortunately, I was able to give a rewarding
                presentation regarding the act at Keller Williams on July 25th with Theresa Racht and David Wald. Below, you may find
                the slides discussed at the presentation.</p>
                
                <p>Thanks to Michael Lulkin and William Wang for assisting with research and taking care of backend business! Kudos to
                Keller Williams and Gold Abstract for making it happen. If anyone has any questions or comments about the new
                legislation, feel free to contact me.</p>
