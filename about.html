            <p>My busy boutique law firm includes many clients (and their family members) who I have successfully represented in all
            facets of real estate law. This includes negotiating complex residential and commercial buy outs, assisting in first
            time cooperative or condominium purchases, collecting arrears from delinquent shareholders, defending (victimized)
            tenants against frivolous non primary residency or owner occupancy proceedings, researching benefits available to senior
            citizens and disabled tenants, and assuring that harassment, discrimination, rent overcharge and reduction of services
            complaints are properly filed and pursued in the appropriate forums.</p>
            
            <p>As a native (and almost senior) New Yorker, I appreciate the anger and angst of appearing in court, and the wide range of
            emotions involved in landlord tenant litigation. Over the years, as corporate counsel for many cooperatives and
            condominiums in Manhattan, and as long term president of my own fifty six unit cooperative on the Upper East Side, I
            have also learned the importance of communicating effectively with real estate brokers, bankers and mortgage brokers,
            managing agents, contractors, neighbors and building staff. Further, I understand the unique financial and legal challenges faced by "mom and pop" operations; that's because my
            father owned two drapery stores on the Lower East Side. Often, we worked side by side, enabling me to learn the fine art
            of negotiations and the value of a dollar. Currently, I am able to apply these principles on a daily basis, by assuring
            that my work product is on time, on track, and on budget.</p>
